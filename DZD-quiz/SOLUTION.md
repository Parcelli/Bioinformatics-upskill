[  Please provide the command to invoke the script that reproduces the below solutions here.  ] 
**Note**:Run the code within the sample_data directory.

Question 1 : bash align.sh mecA.fa

Path to my script [Path](https://github.com/Parcelli/Bioinformatics-upskill/blob/main/DZD-quiz/Scripts/align.sh)

Question 2: bash coverage.sh

Path to my script [Path](https://github.com/Parcelli/Bioinformatics-upskill/blob/main/DZD-quiz/Scripts/coverage.sh)

**Computing fractional coverage and plotting the bar plot**

python 3 coverage.py sample0.txt  5


#### 1. Alignment   

[  If you have reasons for using the aligner that you've used, please provide them here.  ]



#### 2. Fractional Coverage 

[  Please list the fractional coverages for each sample here. If this lives in a file, just specify the 
path.  ]
| Sample      | Fractional Coverage |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| sample0    |0.6307692307692307 |
| sample1  | 1.0       |
| sample2  |0.23376623376623376 |
| sample 3  |0.9734848484848485 |
 


#### 3. Visualizing Fractional Coverage
