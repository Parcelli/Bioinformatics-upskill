#### 1. Alignment   

[  If you have reasons for using the aligner that you've used, please provide them here.  ]



#### 2. Fractional Coverage 

[  Please list the fractional coverages for each sample here. If this lives in a file, just specify the 
path.  ]
| Sample      | Fractional Coverage |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| sample0    |0.6307692307692307 |
| sample1  | 1.0       |
| sample2  |0.23376623376623376 |
| sample 3  |0.9734848484848485 |
