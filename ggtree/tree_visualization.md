# Tree Visualization using ggtree

## Outline

* Introduction to Phylogenies & ggtree package
* Tree visualization
* Tree annotation

### Phlogenetics tree

Phylogenetics tree also known as phylogeny is a diagram representation of evolutionary relationship of species,organisms or genes. Phylogenies are useful for presenting knowledge of *biological diversity*,providing insights into *events* that occurred during evolution /movement  of the organism  and for *structuring classifications*.
In infectious diseases research we construct phylogenetic trees using pathogen genomes inorder to provide insights on epidemiological linkage and probable source of an outbreak.

The trees are generated by different methods and tools including iqtree and BEAST.The output of this programs is a tree in format

## ggtree Package

ggtree is an R package available on Bioconductor for visualizing and annotating phylogenetics tree.
First you'll need to install it if you dont have it already in your R environment.

```
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("ggtree")

```
