## Outline

* Introduction to Phylogenies
* Tree visualization
* Tree annotation

### Phlogenetics tree

Phylogenetics tree also known as phylogeny is a diagram representation of evolutionary relationship of species,organisms or genes. Phylogenies are useful for presenting knowledge of *biological diversity*,providing insights into *events* that occurred during evolution /movement  of the organism  and for *structuring classifications*.
In infectious diseases research we construct phylogenetic trees using pathogen genomes inorder to provide insights on epidemiological linkage and probable source of an outbreak.

* Tree generation and formats

Phylogenetics tree can be generated by either character based methods or distance based methods. The most commonly used methods are the character based methods such as Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) method. These methods use mathematical model to describes the evolution of genetic characters and search for the best phylogenetic tree.Programs like BEAST and iqtree are used to generate phylogenetics trees. The output of such programs is a treefile which can be stored in several formats including Newick,Nexus and Phylip.

* Components of a phylogenetic tree
  
  **Nodes**(tips) : External nodes represent the actual organism that was sequenced and the internal nodes represent hypothetical ancestors for the tips.
  **Branches** : Represent evolutionary changes .
  **Root** : Is a common ancestor of all species in the tree.

## Tree visualization
### ggtree Package

ggtree is an R package available on Bioconductor for visualizing and annotating phylogenetics tree.
First you'll need to install it if you dont have it already in your R environment.

```
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("ggtree")

```
